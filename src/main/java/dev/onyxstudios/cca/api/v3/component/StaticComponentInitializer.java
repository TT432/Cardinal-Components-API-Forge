 * Entrypoint getting invoked to declare static component types.

 * instantiation of a component provider (eg. ItemStack). It is recommended to implement this interface
 * on its own class to avoid running static initializers too early, e.g. because they were referenced in field or method
 * signatures in the same class.
 *
 * <p>The entrypoint is exposed as {@code "cardinal-components:static-init"} in the mod json
 * and runs for any environment. It usually executes right before the first {@link ComponentKey}
 * is created, but can be triggered at any time by another module.
